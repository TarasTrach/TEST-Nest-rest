## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** v23
- **Docker** (for running the database container)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

   cd <your-project-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

## Running the Project

Make sure your Docker daemon is running, then start the application:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:3001` (or as defined by `API_URL`).

---

## Configuration

An `.env` file is in the project root but example:

```env
PORT=3001

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5433
DB_USER=nest
DB_PASSWORD=nest
DB_NAME=test_db
```

---

## Testing

Import the provided Postman collection to test the endpoints:

```
/test/postman_collection.json
```

Use `{{API_URL}}` as the base URL in your Postman environment.

---

## Database Viewer

To browse your database tables, you can use any SQL client. We recommend **TablePlus** for a seamless experience:
